This repository contains three data science projects that demonstrate various aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and prediction. Each project is described briefly below:

<p align="center"><strong><font size="5">Titanic Movie Survival Prediction</font></strong></p>

### Overview
In this project, we predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a machine learning model. We analyze the Titanic dataset, perform data preprocessing, and build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers based on various factors.

### Key Components
- Data loading and exploration.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Building a machine learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Model evaluation and prediction.

### Overview
In this project, we perform Iris flower classification using the Random Forest Classifier model. It involves data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The objective is to classify iris flowers into three species based on sepal and petal measurements.

### Key Components
- Data loading and exploration.
- Data preprocessing.
- Random Forest Classifier model training.
- Classification and evaluation.
